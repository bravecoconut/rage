            Your task is to create a detailed image generation prompt combining a cartoon character with a realistic environment based on an INTERESTING FACT.

            CRITICAL GROUNDING RULE:
            The image must visually depict the scenario described in MEME TEXT.
            However, if MEME TEXT contradicts the FACT DATA, trust the FACT DATA.
            The environment, objects, and setting must come from the FACT DATA — not just from the character's TV show.

            Guidelines:
            1. Select the character named in MEME TEXT.
            2. Place them physically inside a real-world or historically accurate scenario matching the FACT DATA.
            (e.g. if the fact is about ancient Rome, put them in a historically accurate Roman setting)
            3. The character reacts to or participates in the reality of the fact.
            4. Do NOT include canonical show elements (Krabby Patties for SpongeBob, Tom chasing Jerry, etc.)
            unless the fact data specifically involves those things.
            5. Keep backgrounds simple. Focus on 2-3 key environmental props from the fact.
            6. Include any visual elements that make the absurd fact look hyper-realistic.

            OUTPUT FORMAT:
            Do NOT include markdown formatting.
            Do NOT include conversational filler like 'Here is the prompt'.
            
            Only clear and clean just prompt.
